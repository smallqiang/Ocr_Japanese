h1. OCRDemo

OCRDemo is a demo application that utilizes the Tesseract library (http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) as a static library compiled under Mac OS 10.6 using the shell script found at http://robertcarlsen.net/2009/07/15/cross-compiling-for-iphone-dev-884.

The program is only meant to provide a demonstration of the OCR library and it's abilities on the iPhone, the program is not optimized in any way.

The tesseract-2.04 directory was downloaded directly from the Google code project website but it should be noted that the tesseract-2.04/tessdata directory only contains placeholder files and the English processing data is located in OCRDemo/tessdata. Other languages are available on the Google code project website. 

To build the tesseract library run tesseract-2.04/build_fat.sh and the libtesseract_full.a will be in tesseract-2.04/Insout/ however this is not required as their is already a libtesseract_full.a in OCRDemo/.
